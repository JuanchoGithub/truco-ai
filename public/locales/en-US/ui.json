According to Truco rules, the winner of the second trick now wins the entire round. The AI is set up to be the first to play in this decisive second trick and is given a hand that can beat any possible remaining card the opponent might have.

If the AI folds ('No Quiero'), it concedes 1 point and loses the game. If the AI accepts ('Quiero') and loses the trick, it concedes 2 points and also loses the game. The AI is given a very weak hand. The correct strategic play is to always accept ('Quiero'), because folding is a guaranteed loss, whereas accepting provides a slim, non-zero chance of winning if the opponent made a mistake or is bluffing. This scenario tests the AI's endgame logic."

The standard play would be to call Envido immediately. However, the advanced strategy is to 'bait' the opponent by playing a card silently. The goal is to make the opponent think the AI has a weak Envido, encouraging them to call it themselves. This allows the AI to then counter-escalate with 'Real Envido' or 'Falta Envido', maximizing its points in the only phase it can win, while avoiding a likely loss in the Truco phase. This tests the AI's strategic baiting logic."

The AI is given an excellent hand for Envido (e.g., 33 points). The correct play is not to respond to the Truco call directly, but to interrupt the flow of the game by calling 'Envido Primero'. This forces the Envido bet to be resolved before the Truco bet continues. This tests the AI's rule knowledge and ability to prioritize point-scoring opportunities."

According to the rules, Flor beats and nullifies any Envido bet. The AI should not respond to the Envido call (e.g., by accepting or escalating).

Will it play conservatively, or will it take a risk and call 'Truco' immediately, attempting to force the opponent to fold and secure an instant victory? This scenario demonstrates the AI's 'Game Pressure' system and its willingness to make calculated gambles to close out a match."

    "explanations": {
      "accept_truco_do_or_die": "The AI recognizes that folding is a guaranteed loss. Accepting, while risky, is the only play that offers any chance of winning. This is the logical decision in a 'do-or-die' situation.",
      "decline_truco_weak": "The AI evaluates its hand as very weak (usually 50th percentile or lower) and decides it's not worth risking more points. It's a conservative play to minimize losses.",
      "decline_truco_low_equity": "The AI's simulation analysis ('Equity') shows a negative or very low win probability. This means that against the opponent's likely range of hands, it's highly probable to lose. Folding is the mathematically sound decision.",
      "decline_truco_certain_loss": "The AI's simulation predicts a win probability near 0%. Accepting would be a waste of points. This is the most certain fold decision.",
      "accept_truco_solid": "The AI's hand is considered 'solid' (usually 50th percentile or higher). It's strong enough to be competitive and has a reasonable chance to win. Accepting is the standard play.",
      "accept_truco_decent_equity": "The AI's simulation analysis ('Equity') is positive or only slightly negative. It indicates that while not a sure win, the odds are good enough to make accepting the bet profitable in the long run.",
      "accept_truco_bluff_call": "The AI has a weak hand, but other factors (like 'Game Pressure' or the opponent's behavioral model) suggest the opponent might be bluffing. This is a risky play to 'catch' a bluff.",
      "escalate_truco_high_equity": "The AI's simulation analysis ('Equity') is very high, indicating a dominant win probability. The AI not only accepts but raises the bet to maximize point gain.",
      "escalate_truco_strong": "The AI's hand is strong (usually 75th percentile or higher). The AI is confident in its hand and escalates the bet to pressure the opponent.",
      "escalate_truco_elite": "The AI's hand is elite (90th percentile or higher), containing top-tier power cards. Escalating is almost always the correct play to maximize value.",
      "escalate_truco_bluff": "The AI escalates the bet despite having a weak hand. This is a pure bluff, based on factors like the opponent's high fold rate or 'Game Pressure' (desperation).",
      "escalate_truco_weak_bluff": "Similar to a regular bluff, but specifically when the hand is notably weak. It's a high-risk play to steal the round.",
      "escalate_truco_desperation_bluff": "The AI is about to lose the game and has a losing hand. Its only hope is an extreme bluff to force the opponent to fold. This is a 'last resort' play.",
      "call_truco_bluff": "The AI initiates the Truco bet with a weak hand, hoping to intimidate the opponent into folding. The decision is based on the opponent model and game pressure.",
      "call_truco_value": "The AI initiates the Truco bet because its simulation analysis shows a high probability of winning. This is called a 'value bet'.",
      "call_truco_won_trick1": "The AI has already won the first trick and has a strong hand for the second. Calling Truco now applies maximum pressure, as the opponent must win both remaining tricks.",
      "call_truco_certain_win": "The AI has deduced, based on cards played, that its remaining card cannot be beaten. Calling Truco is a way to maximize points from a guaranteed win.",
      "call_truco_parda_y_gano": "The first trick was a tie. The AI realizes it holds a card that guarantees a win in the second trick (and thus the round). It calls Truco before playing it.",
      "call_truco_post_parda_bluff": "The first trick was a tie, and the AI holds a weak hand for the second. However, it leverages the ambiguity of the situation to attempt a bluff.",
      "call_envido_strong": "The AI has a high Envido score (usually 28+) and calls to secure those points.",
      "call_envido_bluff": "The AI has a low Envido score but calls anyway, hoping the opponent will fold and concede 1 point. This is more likely if the opponent has a high Envido fold rate.",
      "call_envido_marginal": "The AI's Envido score is neither high nor low (24-27). The AI makes a speculative call with a small probability.",
      "call_real_dominant": "The AI has a very high Envido (30+) and calls 'Real Envido' to up the ante and win 3 points instead of 2.",
      "call_falta_win_game": "The AI has an excellent Envido and is a few points away from winning the game. It calls 'Falta Envido' as a game-winning attempt.",
      "call_falta_defensive": "The opponent is about to win. The AI has a strong Envido and calls 'Falta Envido' as a defensive measure to try and steal the game.",
      "decline_envido_weak": "The AI calculates its Envido score is too low to compete against the opponent's likely range. It folds to lose only 1 point.",
      "accept_envido_good_odds": "The AI's Envido score is good enough that accepting the bet is profitable, even if it's not a guaranteed win.",
      "accept_envido_hero_call": "The AI believes it has a low chance, but the probability of the opponent bluffing is high enough to justify the risk of accepting.",
      "escalate_real_stronger": "The opponent called 'Envido', but the AI has a much higher score and counters with 'Real Envido' to increase pressure and points.",
      "escalate_envido_strong": "The opponent called 'Envido', and the AI also has a good score. Instead of just accepting, it calls 'Envido' again ('Envido-Envido') to double the bet.",
      "call_flor_strong": "The AI has 'Flor' (three cards of the same suit) and is obligated to declare it to win 3 points.",
      "ack_flor_weak": "The opponent declared 'Flor', and the AI also has one, but with a low score. The AI concedes defeat in this phase rather than risk a 'Contraflor'.",
      "ack_flor_no_flor": "The opponent declared 'Flor' and the AI does not have one. The AI must accept and concede the points.",
      "call_contraflor_strong": "The opponent declared 'Flor', but the AI also has one and believes its score is high enough (30+) to win a showdown. It escalates the bet to 6 points.",
      "accept_contraflor_strong": "The opponent responded to the AI's 'Flor' with a 'Contraflor'. The AI is confident in its score and accepts the showdown for 6 points.",
      "decline_contraflor_weak": "The opponent responded with 'Contraflor'. The AI is not confident in its score and folds, conceding 4 points instead of risking 6.",
      "see_opponent": "The AI plays a low or medium-value card to gain information about the opponent's hand without risking its best cards.",
      "secure_hand": "The AI plays its strongest card to ensure victory in a crucial trick, especially if it is 'hand' or has already won the first trick.",
      "win_round_cheap": "The AI needs to play a card that wins the current trick, but it uses the weakest of its winning cards to save stronger ones for later.",
      "discard_low": "The AI recognizes it cannot win the current trick and plays its weakest card to save better ones for the next trick.",
      "parda_y_canto": "The AI intentionally ties the first trick, knowing it has a very strong card in reserve. This gives it a strategic advantage to call 'Truco' in the second trick.",
      "unknown_action": "The action taken does not have a specific reason key. This could be a fallback state or a simple, unclassified action.",
      "accept_truco_lookahead_fold": "The AI has a hand strong enough to accept a 'Truco', but its 'pre-commitment' logic simulates that it would fold if the opponent escalated to 'Vale Cuatro'. Therefore, it chooses the safer play of just accepting.",
      "escalate_truco_dominant_card": "The AI is in the final trick and holds a card that is almost certainly the winner (e.g., Ace of Swords against a depleted hand). It escalates the bet to maximize points from a highly probable win.",
      "accept_truco_mixed": "As part of a strategy to be less predictable, the AI randomly chooses to accept in a borderline situation where folding would also be a reasonable choice.",
      "decline_truco_mixed": "As part of a strategy to be less predictable, the AI randomly chooses to fold in a borderline situation where accepting would also be a reasonable choice.",
      "escalate_truco_mixed_bluff": "As part of a strategy to be less predictable, the AI randomly chooses to attempt a bluff by escalating the bet in a situation that would not normally warrant it."
